        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hiii, Welcome to Usagi Staking! ‚úø</h2>
            <p>Oh, hello there, little friend! We‚Äôre so happy to see you in the adorable world of Usagi Staking! This is a super fun place on the Shibarium blockchain where you can grow your USAGI tokens with a big smile! üå∏</p>
            <p>With Usagi Staking, you can stake your LP tokens (vAMM-CHIKA/WBONE) and USAGI tokens to earn more USAGI as a sweet reward! It‚Äôs as easy as picking flowers, and we‚Äôll show you how to join the fun!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What‚Äôs Usagi Staking All About? üåü</h2>
            <p>Usagi Staking is like a little garden where you can plant your tokens to help the Shibarium community bloom! By staking, you‚Äôre giving a big hug to the network, and in return, you‚Äôll get more USAGI tokens to make you happy! üíñ</p>
            <p>We have two cute ways to stake:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">LP Staking</span>: Plant your vAMM-CHIKA/WBONE LP tokens to grow USAGI rewards!</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">USAGI Staking</span>: Plant your USAGI tokens to grow even more USAGI!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Let‚Äôs Stake and Grow Together! üå±</h2>
            <p>Here‚Äôs how you can start your happy staking journey with Usagi:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stake LP Tokens</strong>: You can stake your LP tokens in bundles of 1,000,000 or more (like 1,000,000, 2,000,000, and so on). For every 1,000,000 LP tokens you stake, you‚Äôll get 500 USAGI per block at the beginning! Yay!</li>
                <li><strong>Stake USAGI Tokens</strong>: You can stake your USAGI tokens in bundles of 10,000 or more (like 10,000, 20,000, and so on). For every 10,000 USAGI you stake, you‚Äôll get 0.025 USAGI per block at the start! So cute!</li>
                <li><strong>Grow Your Rewards</strong>: Your rewards grow every block, which is about 5 seconds on Shibarium. You can pick your rewards anytime you want, or they‚Äôll magically appear when you stake more or take your tokens back!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let‚Äôs look at some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you stake 1,000,000 LP tokens and wait for 100 blocks, you‚Äôll get 500 * 100 = 50,000 USAGI! Wow, so many!</li>
                <li>If you stake 10,000 USAGI tokens and wait for 100 blocks, you‚Äôll get 0.025 * 100 = 2.5 USAGI! A little treat for you!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Rewards Get a Little Smaller Over Time üåº</h2>
            <p>We want to make sure everyone gets a chance to enjoy Usagi Staking for a long, long time, so the rewards will slowly get a tiny bit smaller as time goes on. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs still super fun! Here‚Äôs how it works on Shibarium:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Every 600,000 blocks</strong> (about 35 days on Shibarium, since each block is 5 seconds), the rewards shrink a little bit.</li>
                <li><strong>For LP Staking</strong>: You start with 500 USAGI per block for every 1,000,000 LP tokens. Then it changes like this:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After 600,000 blocks (35 days): 490 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 1,200,000 blocks (70 days): 480 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 1,800,000 blocks (105 days): 470 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 2,400,000 blocks (140 days): 460 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¶and so on!</li>
                    <li>After 29,400,000 blocks (about 1,700 days), it reaches the smallest amount: 10 USAGI per block for every 1,000,000 LP tokens.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>For USAGI Staking</strong>: You start with 0.025 USAGI per block for every 10,000 USAGI tokens. Then it changes like this:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After 600,000 blocks (35 days): 0.0245 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 1,200,000 blocks (70 days): 0.024 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 1,800,000 blocks (105 days): 0.0235 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>After 2,400,000 blocks (140 days): 0.023 USAGI per block.</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¶and so on!</li>
                    <li>After 29,400,000 blocks (about 1,700 days), it reaches the smallest amount: 0.0005 USAGI per block for every 10,000 USAGI tokens.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Even when the rewards get smaller, you‚Äôll still be earning USAGI tokens for your staking efforts! It‚Äôs like getting a little sprinkle of magic every day! ‚ú®</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Pick Your Rewards Anytime! üçì</h2>
            <p>You can pick your USAGI rewards whenever you feel like it! There‚Äôs no waiting time at all, so you can collect your shiny tokens anytime you want. You‚Äôll also get your rewards automatically when you stake more tokens or take your tokens back. So easy, right? üåà</p>
            <p>Just a tiny reminder: You need to have some tokens staked (either LP or USAGI) to get rewards. If you don‚Äôt have anything staked, there won‚Äôt be any rewards to pick up, okay?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fees and Little Extras üåü</h2>
            <p>When you stake or take back your LP tokens, we‚Äôll collect any fees that the LP tokens make (like trading fees) and give them to the Usagi team to help our project grow even more! This doesn‚Äôt cost you anything extra‚Äîit‚Äôs just a little thank-you to the team for taking care of Usagi! üíï</p>
            <p>Staking USAGI tokens is completely free, with no fees at all! You can stake and unstake as much as you like without any worries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Total Rewards to Share! üç¨</h2>
            <p>We‚Äôve set aside 1 trillion USAGI tokens just for staking rewards! That‚Äôs a lot of tokens to share with all our friends! Once all these tokens are given out, the staking program will end, and no more rewards will be made. This way, everyone gets a fair chance to join the fun for a long time! üåü</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
